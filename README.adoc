= Bank account service

Think of your personal bank account experience. When in doubt, go for the simplest solution

== Requirements

* Deposit and Withdrawal
* Account statement (date, amount, balance)
* Statement printing
* The expected result is a service API (not a REST API), and its underlying implementation (in Java), that meets the expressed needs.
* Nothing more, especially no UI, no persistence.

NOTE: la persistance a été mise en place avec une base in-memory H2, et on a des API REST
